# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting **car prices** using **Linear Regression**, one of the fundamental machine learning algorithms.
The goal is to analyze the dataset, understand feature–price relationships, and build a regression model to estimate car prices based on given attributes.

The full workflow is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** for clarity and reproducibility.

## 📌 Project Objectives

* Understand the structure of a real-world car price dataset
* Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
* Analyze relationships between car features and prices
* Build a **Linear Regression** model
* Evaluate model performance

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes various features that influence car prices, such as:

* Brand / Model
* Year
* Mileage
* Engine specifications
* Fuel type
* Transmission
* Price (target variable)

*(Exact features may vary depending on the dataset used in the notebook.)*

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project includes:

* Statistical summary of features
* Detection of missing or inconsistent values
* Visualization of:

  * Price distribution
  * Feature–price relationships
  * Correlation between numerical variables

EDA helps identify which factors most strongly affect car prices.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### Linear Regression

Steps followed:

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Feature scaling (if required)
2. **Model Training**

   * Linear Regression model fitting
3. **Model Evaluation**

   * R² Score
   * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   * Interpretation of regression coefficients

This approach provides a solid baseline for regression problems.
